# Drawer

The `<Drawer>` component is a wrapper around the [Material UI Drawer](https://material-ui.com/api/drawer/) that adds specific Brightlayer UI functionality and styling. It is used to organize content (typically navigation links) in a collapsible side panel. The Brightlayer UI Drawer includes helper components for `<DrawerHeader>`, `<DrawerSubheader>`, `<DrawerBody>`, `<DrawerNavGroup>`, `<DrawerNavItem>`, `<DrawerRailItem>`, `<DrawerFooter>`, and `<DrawerLayout>` to help organize the content.
