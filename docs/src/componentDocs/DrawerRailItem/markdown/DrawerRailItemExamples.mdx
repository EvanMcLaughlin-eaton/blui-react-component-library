# Rail Variant

When using the `rail` variant of the [`<Drawer>`](/components/drawer/api-docs), `<DrawerRailItem>` should be used instead of [`<DrawerNavItem>`](/components/drawer/drawer-nav-item/api-docs). The `<DrawerRailItem>` is always collapsed version of the [`<Drawer>`](/components/drawer/api-docs) that only displays an icons and titles.

<RailDrawer />

# Rail Condensed Variant

The `<DrawerRailItem>` can be `condensed` so that it only displays icons. Each navigation item will show a tooltip when hovered while in this mode.

<CondensedRailDrawer />
