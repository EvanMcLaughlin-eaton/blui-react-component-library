# Drawer Layout

The `<DrawerLayout>` manages how a `<Drawer>` and its application content is displayed. It supports four different variant options - `permanent`, `persistent`, `temporary`, and `rail`.

# Permanent Variant

The `permanent` variant is used when a `<Drawer>` is never intended to dismiss from the screen.

<PermanentDrawer />

# Persistent Variant

The `persistent` variant allows a `<Drawer>` to open and close, but never fully exits the screen.

<PersistentDrawer />

# Temporary Variant

The `temporary` variant allows a `<Drawer>` to enter the screen from the left side as an overlay.

<TemporaryDrawer />

# Rail Variant

The `rail` variant is similar to a collapsed persistent state.

<RailDrawer />

# Rail Condensed Variant

The `rail` variant can be `condensed` so that it only displays icons. Each navigation item will show a tooltip when hovered while in this mode.
