# Drawer Layout

The `<DrawerLayout>` component is used to provide the appropriate resizing behavior for your main application content when used in conjunction with a Brightlayer UI [`<Drawer>`](/components/drawer/api-docs). It accepts a [`<Drawer>`](/components/drawer/api-docs) as a prop, and the main page content is passed in through child elements.
