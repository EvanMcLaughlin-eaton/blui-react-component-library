## Collapsible App Bar

An `<AppBar>` is an extension of the [`MUI Toolbar`](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/toolbar/) that can expand and collapse as you scroll the page.

<AppBar />

## Permanently Collapsed

Setting the variant to `collapsed` will lock the App Bar at its collapsed size and it will behave like a default toolbar.

## Permanently Expanded

Setting the variant to `expanded` will lock the App Bar at its expanded size.

<ExpandedAppBar />

## Adding Additional Content

You can organize the contents of your App Bar by adding a [`Toolbar`](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/toolbar/) component, just as you would with a [`MUI App Bar`](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/app-bar/) component.
