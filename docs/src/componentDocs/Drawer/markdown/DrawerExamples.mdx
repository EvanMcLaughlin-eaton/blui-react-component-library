# Basic Drawer

A `<Drawer />` is a navigation menu that appears to the side of an application.

# Drawer Anatomy

A `<Drawer />` can be broken down into the following subsections:

-   [`<DrawerHeader />`](/components/drawer/drawer-header/examples)
-   [`<DrawerSubheader />`](/components/drawer-sub-header/examples)
-   [`<DrawerBody />`](/components/drawer-body/examples)
-   [`<DrawerNavItem />`](/components/drawer/drawer-nav-item/examples)
-   [`<DrawerNavGroup />`](/components/drawer/drawer-nav-group/examples)
-   [`<DrawerFooter />`](/components/drawer-footer/examples)

# Complex Drawer

As an alternative to structuring all navigation items within a template, navigation items can be declared within a list and looped over to build a more complex `<Drawer />`.
